	/// and a reference clock.  The PhaseLockClock then creates a
	/// VariableFrequency clock around the primary clock.  It also spawns a thread
	/// that periodically measures the phase of the VariableFrequencyClock and
	/// the reference clock in order to keep them in sync.
	/// 
	/// - Assumes the primary and reference clocks run at 1000000 Hz
	/// - The update interval is initially set at 1 second
	/// - the actual updates occur randomly at up to %10 of the update interval.
	///   this is to prevent the server from being swamped with synchronous requests
